# CodeQuizz

## Description

Developed a quick basic Javascript quiz with timer, the score would be the timer caught at the end of the quizz,
and also a window for Highest scores which would be stored on local storage.
for every wrong answer 10 seconds would be substracted from the timer 

## User Story

AS A coding boot camp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers
```
